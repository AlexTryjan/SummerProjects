THE SLIDER CODE IS NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK. I just incorporated it to fool around with some web design things when I found myself with little else to do.

The remaining code accesses an old database on my former employers server. The code intends to Create new data, Remove data, Update data, and Display the list of all data to a website. (hence the name C.R.U.D.)

This helped me to familiarize myself with ColdFusion, small scale web-design and database queries/accessing.
